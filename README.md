This anxiety_attack_dataset measures age, gender, occupation, lifestyles like sleep hour, caffeine intake, alcohol intake, smoking condition, it also measures health indicators like heart rate, breathing rate, sweating, dizziness. The most important thing is that it measures anxiety attack severity scaling from 1 to 10, which would be a very significant result. It also includes other indicators and factors such as dizziness, medication, diet quality.
